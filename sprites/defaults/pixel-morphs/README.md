# Pixel Morph Sprites

Upload custom pixel art shapes here. These work like circles - they'll be colorized based on the viewer's Twitch username color.

**Requirements:**
- Black/dark colored shapes (will be colorized)
- PNG or GIF format
- Recommended size: 40x40px to 80x80px
- Transparent background preferred
- Can be any shape (stars, hearts, diamonds, etc.)

The widget will automatically apply the viewer's Twitch color to these sprites, just like the circles.
