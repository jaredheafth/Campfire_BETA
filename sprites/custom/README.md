# Custom Sprites

Upload custom sprites here for the "Custom" sprite mode. These sprites will be used as-is (not colorized).

**Requirements:**
- PNG or GIF format (animated GIFs supported)
- Recommended size: 40x40px to 80x80px
- Transparent background preferred

**How it works:**
- When "Custom" mode is selected, viewers can upload their own sprites
- Or the streamer can upload a single sprite that all viewers use
- Colors are applied to the username (not the sprite)
