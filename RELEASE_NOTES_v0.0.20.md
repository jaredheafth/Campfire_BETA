# 🔥 Campfire Widget v0.0.20 - Desktop App

## 🐛 Fixes

### Sprite facing/orientation while moving
- Fixed sprites briefly snapping back to their “default” facing while moving.
- Movement animations no longer override the sprite’s **flip + perspective scaling**, so sprites keep the correct orientation continuously during motion.

## ✨ Included (from v0.0.19)
- “**FLICKER**” front glow layer with **Flicker Opacity** + **Flicker Size/Spread** sliders (Dashboard → Glow).
