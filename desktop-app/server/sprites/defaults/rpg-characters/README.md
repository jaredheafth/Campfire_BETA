# RPG Character Sprites

Upload RPG character sprites here. Viewers can choose from these characters, or they'll be randomly assigned if not logged in.

**Requirements:**
- PNG or GIF format (animated GIFs supported)
- Recommended size: 40x40px to 80x80px
- Transparent background preferred
- Each file should be a complete character sprite

**How it works:**
- Logged-in viewers can select their character from the viewer dashboard
- Non-logged-in viewers get a random character assigned
- The viewer's username color is applied to their name (not the sprite)
