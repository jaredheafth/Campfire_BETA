# 🔥 Campfire Widget v0.0.13 - Desktop App

## 🐛 Fixes

### No Command Bubbles
- Any chat message that starts with `!` is now treated as a **command-only** message and will **not** render as a chat bubble above the user.

### Chat Commands Improvements
- `!cw` / `!ccw` now correctly trigger in-widget movement (desktop app path).
- Join via **emote name** works when Join Method is set to **Emote**.
- `!next` / `!back` cycle RPG sprites and persist to the user.
- `!color` now persists even if the user sets it before joining.
